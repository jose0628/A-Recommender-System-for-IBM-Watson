# A-Recommender-System-for-IBM-Watson

Based on interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, I designed a recommended system, which makes recommendations of articles to users. The type of recommended systems selected are:

* Rank Based Recommendations
* User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

## Project Requirements

* Jupiter Notebook with Python3 and [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (recommended)
